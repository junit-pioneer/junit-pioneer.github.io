JUnit Pioneer is an http://blog.codefx.org/design/architecture/junit-5-extension-model/[extension pack] for JUnit 5 or, to be http://blog.codefx.org/design/architecture/junit-5-architecture/[more precise], for the Jupiter engine.
It is currently being set up, so this site as well as the repo is a little shy on content - we hope to fix that soon!

There are various ways to help us get there if you're interested:

* if you have an idea for an extension you could make good use of, https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/new[open an issue]
* if you already wrote some code and would like to release it as part of JUnit Pioneer, which is an awesome idea, please also https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/new[open an issue] (rather than a pull request)
* if you want to contribute but aren't sure how, have a look at https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues[the list of open issues], particularly those https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs[marked as _up for grabs_]
